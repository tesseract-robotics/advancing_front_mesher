# Advancing Front Mesher

This package contains an implementation of the advancing front surface reconstruction algorithm based on the following papers:

1. *High-Quality Extraction of Isosurfaces from Regular and Irregular Grids*
J. Schreiner, C. Scheidegger, C. Silva
IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (Proceedings of IEEE Visualization); 2006

1. *Direct (Re)Meshing for Efficient Surface Processing*
J. Schreiner, C. Scheidegger, S. Fleishman, C. Silva
Computer Graphics Forum (Proceedings of Eurographics); 2006

1. *Triangulating Point-Set Surfaces With Bounded Error*
C. Scheidegger, S. Fleishman, C. Silva
Proceedings of the third Eurographics/ACM Symposium on Geometry Processing; 2005

PCL 1.9 is required to build this package
